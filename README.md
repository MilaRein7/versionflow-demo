project for version demonstration

## version history

### v1.0.0 - initial release
- the very first version of the program
- function: greeting
- chosen as 1.0.0 because this is the very first complete version

### v1.1.0 - add name parameter
- added a name parameter to the greeting function
- chosen as 1.1.0 because this is a small addition to the program, not a big change

### v1.1.1 - fix input validation
- fixed a bug in the name input: previously any characters could be entered, now only letters are allowed
- empty input and non-letter characters are rejected
- —Åhosen as 1.1.1 because this is a minor bug fix, not a new feature.

### v1.2.0 - feature: get codename
- added the ability to get a codename
- chosen as v.1.2.0 because this is a new feature, a bigger change than a simple fix
